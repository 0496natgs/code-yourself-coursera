### **Count controlled loops**

- **Iteration:** repetitive of sections of a program without stopping
- **Infinite loops:** loops that never ends

### **Bucles (loops) existen dos tipos:**

1. **Count controlled loops:** Permiten repetir una sección de un programa un número específico de veces.
2.  **Condition controlled loops:** Permiten repetir una sección de un programa hasta que una específica condición se cumple (o hasta que algo pasa)

## 1. Events

Events are things that happen, occurrences or actions that take place.

- They’re useful when building computer games, also in robotics and web-based systems.
- **Programming approach:** event-driven programming.
    - Is a flow of the program is determined by events, such as user actions, or sensor inputs. An event-driven program, is constantly listening for events, and when these occur, a particular behavior is triggered.

## 2. Software Requirements, Design and Implementation

### 2.1 Vocabulary

- **Software engineering terms:** software design should precede software implementation.
- **Software Design:** Software design involves describing all aspects of the software to be built, such as the user interface and the functionality of the software.
- **User interface:** is the means in which the user interacts with or controls the software application.
    - **Graphical user interfaces** are particularly popular as it makes it easier, more intuitive, and pleasant to use the software applications.

**Ask myself this questions every time I want to code something:**

- what should this element look like? Where should it be positioned? When does it appear or disappear?
- **Things to consider when implementing:**
    - how the user will interact with the program you're building
    - how easy it is for a new user to interact with your program

### 2.2 Cut the fruit!

**Link to exercise:** [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/634009264](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/634009264)

- **Game progress:**
    - **Forever**
    - Place the entire fruit on screen
    - Wait until fruit is cut
    - Switch costume to cut
    - Switch costume to next entire fruit

### 2.3 Software Requirements

- Is: The gathering and analysis of requirements involves figuring out the goal of the software, and the needs it is meant to address. It is the what, rather than the how question.
    - is a crucial phase of the software engineering process

### 2.4 Abstraction

When designing the code **it is important to avoid any unnecessary detail.** 

- In computer science this is called abstraction, and it involves abordar el problem by focusing only on its important aspects.
- Abstraction also involves choosing the right level of detail.
